Datasets used in the proposed model are Action Movies, Hockey Fight, Violent Flows, and UBI-Fights
In preprocessing stage, 16 keyframes are extracted using MS-SSIM.
The extracted frames are forwarded to CBAM module to derive discriminant information about motion regions.
Then, the CNN is trained and tested on the datasets.
